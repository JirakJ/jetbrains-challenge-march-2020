    Welcome to the JetBrains Quest.
    
    What awaits ahead is a series of challenges. Each one will require a little initiative, a little thinking, and a whole lot of JetBrains to get to the end. Cheating is allowed and in some places encouraged. You have until the 15th of March at 12:00 CET to finish the 3 quests.
    Getting to the end of each quest will earn you a reward.
    Let the quest commence!
    
    JetBrains has a lot of products, but there is one that looks like a joke on our Products page, you should start there...
    It’s dangerous to go alone take this key: Good luck! == Jrrg#oxfn$

    You have discovered our JetBrains Quest! If you don’t know what this is, you should start from Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn.
    
    To continue to the next challenge you need to go to the following link… But there is a problem, the last 3 digits are missing:

    https://jb.gg/###

    To get these digits you need to know how many prime numbers there are between 500 and 5000

    Good Luck!

Now we have to findout count of prime numbers in given range.
    
    Solution is https://jb.gg/574
    
This link will redirect as to pycharm forum, where is billiard table with YouTrack issue number. Now we have find out this issue MPS-31816.
